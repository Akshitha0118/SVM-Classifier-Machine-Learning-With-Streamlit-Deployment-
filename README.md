# 📊 SVM Classifier Dashboard using Streamlit

An interactive **Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification dashboard** built using **Streamlit**, featuring a modern dark UI, real-time predictions, model evaluation metrics, and visual analytics — all without requiring data upload.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a trained **SVM classifier** can be deployed as a **web-based dashboard** using Streamlit.  
Users can input feature values (Age & Estimated Salary) and instantly receive predictions along with confidence probability.

The dashboard also visualizes:
- Model accuracy
- Bias (training score)
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve and AUC score

## 🧪 Sample Prediction Workflow

1. Select **Age** and **Estimated Salary** from the sidebar  
2. Adjust the input sliders  
3. View the prediction result:
   - ✅ **WILL BUY**
   - ❌ **WILL NOT BUY**
4. Observe the **model probability** and **evaluation metrics**

## 📊 Model Evaluation Visuals

- **Confusion Matrix**  
  Displays correct vs incorrect classification results  

- **ROC Curve**  
  Visualizes the classifier’s performance across different thresholds  

- **AUC Score**  
  Measures the overall quality of the classification model
